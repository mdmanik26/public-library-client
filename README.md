# About the project

- Clicking on any category on the home page displays all the books of that category on the other page, with each book having an details button. Clicking the details button opens another page. We can see the book information on that page.

- If a user logs into the project, the navbar shows that user's picture, name, and a logout button. Clicking the Logout button logs the user out of the site and displays a signup button, removing the user's information from the navbar.
